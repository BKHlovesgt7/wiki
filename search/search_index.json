If you're on the same wifi or hotspot network, it should be easy. Start playing a game, open the pause menu and press \"Host Multiplayer Game\" button. This will make your game available to everyone in the same network. To join this game from another device, click Play > Join Game. If another player is hosting, the game should pop up in the list of servers. I can't find my friend's multiplayer game! If you are sure that you are on the same network, and you still can't find their game, considering using a wifi hotspot instead of a public network. Some public wifi networks simply do not allow server discovery. If you're using a wifi hotspot and you still can't find a friend's game, you could try connecting directly via IP. Instead of looking for the game, find the internal IP of the hosting device (look up how to find it for the specific device you're using), and have the other player type in that IP in the Play > Join Game > Add Server button. How can I play with someone across networks? You need to port forward and share your IP with the other players. See the guide here. Consider using a public server, such as those that are on the game already. How do I set up a dedicated server? / How do I port forward? See this guide. Can PC players play with iOS/Android players? Yes, Mindustry is fully cross-platform. As long as all the devices are running the same version of Mindustry, any device can connect to any other device. How do I import a map? First of all, you need to make sure that the map is compatible with your game version. If you're running Mindustry 4.0 or later, you need a .msav map file. Once you download the file onto your device, open the Mindustry main menu. Select Editor -> Import Map (on the top of the screen). Find the directory that the map is in, select the file and press \"open\". Note that the file chooser will only display files with an .msav extension. If you can't find the file, make sure that you're looking in the right place and that the extension is correct. Note that Discord may sometimes remove the extension from files when downloading, so you'll need to open your file browser of choice and add the extension manually. How do I export a map file? Open your map in the editor. Open the menu, then press \"Export\". Select a directory, type in a filename and press \"Save\". I don't like the current version of Mindustry for some reason, what do I do? Just download Mindustry Classic for the old experience. It's identical to build 3.5 40, albeit with some minor bugfixes. PC/Android APK: https://anuke.itch.io/mindustry-classic You can also find it by searching \"mindustry classic\" on the Google Play store. Does Mindustry run on a Raspberry Pi? While the game itself could theoretically support it, no, it does not support the Raspberry Pi. However, the dedicated server will run on a Pi as long as you have the right version of Java installed. Note that the 3.5/Classic dedicated server will not run on a Pi; only 4.0 and above is supported. Where is the game's source code? On GitHub: https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry Did Anuke make the game alone? For the most part, yes. Music, graphics and programming are done by me. Translations are made by contributors from the community. Some people also contribute to the game's code by submitting pull requests on GitHub. These people are marked with a Contributor role on Discord. There are many people who contribute to the wiki/documentation as well. How do I join the Google Play beta program? Open the Google Play page for Mindustry, scroll to the bottom of the page and tap 'join beta'. Beta builds can take some time to become available after tapping the button. Be patient. I do not control how fast this happens; it is handled automatically by Google. I can't connect to servers / My game is out of date. What do I do? If you're using Google Play on Android, wait for an update to become available. Builds are usually updated before the announcement is made, but Google may take hours to process it. Be patient. If you're on iOS, it's the same deal, except you may need to wait a bit longer. iOS builds take a longer time to release, and Apple takes 1-2 days to verify each release even after they are uploaded. If you're using the desktop version, just go on itch.io using the links at the top of this channel and download the game again. Updating should not reset progress. Are Anuke and Anuken different people? They are very well the same person. Anuke(n) uses \"Anuken\" when \"Anuke\" is taken. I usually use Anuken when Anuke is taken as a username. -Anuken Why are you charging for the game on Steam and iOS when it is available for free? The game is being charged for on Steam and iOS because it is one way of supporting Anuke, and it has features not available on the free versions, such as: A map, mod, and schematic browser Secure, seamless multiplayer using Steam Multiplayer (eliminates the need to port-forward) Publicly visible servers at startup Achievements Stat tracking Cloud saves and progress transfer using Steam Steam community How can I contribute to the game? The easiest way is to give constructive feedback and discussion (preferably about the game) in our Discord Server. Report bugs that you find on the GitHub repository. Please remember to use the templates properly , as doing so will make your issue more organized and follow a common pattern, making Anuke's job easier. If you know how to program in Java, feel free to help Anuke out and fix said bugs, then open a PR. Donations to Anuke are open on the Itch.io page if you would like to give a monetary contribution. You can also buy the game on Steam. If you are fluent in a language that Mindustry doesn't support yet, or if you want to contribute to the ones already there, stop by the #translations channel, and ask about it. You can contribute to the current bundles and open a PR in the game's repo. If you want to contribute to this wiki, please contact Anuke or Luxray5474.

There are two main types of servers; dedicated servers and local LAN servers. Dedicated Servers Dedicated servers are standalone, headless versions of the game that are focused only on providing a means for people to play Multiplayer. They are usually run on a computer as a separate program rather than in-game, and are operated from the terminal. These are usually stronger than a local LAN server as they have more resources available to them to support more than two or three players, and can be run 24/7. They are also more versatile and powerful in that they have many commands to provide the administrator with more control over it, and they can easily be modded to fit the administrator's needs. You can connect to one using the \"Join Game\" button under the \"Play\" menu. Unlike local LAN servers, you will have to enter the host's IP address and port. Also unlike local LAN servers, once you add a server, it will automatically show up on your server list when you open it, and the game will automatically check the server's status. To establish a dedicated server, a dedicated Linux or Windows machine is highly recommended. If you haven't already, install Java. Download the desired server release from itch.io or Github releases . The filename should be server.jar or server-release.jar , although if you are on Windows it may only show as server or server-release . Move the server file to your desired folder. It is recommended to place it in a new directory on your desktop. Open a new terminal window(CMD if you are on windows). Use the command \" cd \" to navigate into the directory you placed the server file in, ex cd Desktop then cd Server . Run java -jar [server].jar , replacing [server] with the name of your server file. Your server should start. Type help for a list of all console commands. If you get a message similar to \"Unable to access file server.jar\" you are likely in the wrong directory. Start hosting a map with the command host <mapname> [mode] . If you are using Windows to run your server, use your favorite search engine to look up how to add rules to your Windows Firewall, as it blocks the necessary port most of the time. Make sure to allow port 6567 TCP and UDP . To close the server, either close the terminal window or press Ctrl+C on the terminal window. Unless you have already enabled port forwarding, your dedicated server can only be connected to by clients within your local network. If you want to make your server globally available, read below. What is an IP and how do I find out what mine is? In simplified terms, an IP address is a number that identifies your computer on the internet. You can connect to someone's Mindustry server if you know their IP address. There are two types; a public and a local address. For a local IP , when for example you would like to play with a friend on the same network as yours, each device has its own way of showing it. You can Google how to do it for your device, e.g. \"find local ip on Mac\". For a public IP , you can simply Google \"what is my ip\". Running A Dedicated Server At Home Most of the time, this is what you should remember; never share your public IP with the public if you're hosting from your home, unless you acknowledge the implications of doing so! Your public IP is tied to your household, and if it falls into the wrong hands, and when put into the wrong hands, can open up your network to vulnerabilities and dangers. Exercise caution, do your research, and use a VPN or webhost if possible. It is also recommended and that you use a domain name or DNS service to mask your IP for public servers for ease of use, or even better, use a cloud service e.g. Amazon AWS or a dedicated server/VM from a hosting provider such as Linode or DigitalOcean, which is much safer. Do your research , and determine which option best fits your needs. Find the make/model of your router. This is usually on a sticker on the bottom or back of the router. Use your favorite search engine to search \"port forward ASUS RT-ACRH17\" and use the guide to foward port 6567 TCP and UDP . These instructions are different for every router, so be sure to read your guide thoroughly! You can use a service such as You Get Signal to check if you have done your portforwarding correctly. Local LAN & Steam Servers A local LAN or Steam server is a server that is built into the game, and can be started using the \"Host Multiplayer Game\" button in the in-game menu. It is meant to be simple and straightforward, for sessions between a few players under a LAN network (aka in your household's WiFi network). It is not really meant for several players, as it takes more and more resources from your device to be able to use it that way; for that you will need a dedicated server mentioned above. It can only run when the game is open, and is immediately terminated when it is closed. You can connect to one using the \"Join Game\" button under the \"Play\" menu. Unlike dedicated servers, your device will automatically find the host device and it will ususally appear in the server list without you having to enter the host's IP address in.

Mindustry Logic (mlog) is a scripting language added in v6 for the purpose of introducing more advanced automation and strategy into the game. It is heavily inspired by Assembly languages, where there is only one instruction or operation at a time. This is quite unlike more popular languages such as Python, Java, or C++, where you have convenient ways to create one-liners, functions, conditional statements, loops, and classes. The current capabilities of the language are: Getting information about blocks and units, including the player Controlling buildings and turrets Controlling and writing/reading information to/from units Displaying shapes and colors in displays Outputting text through message blocks Reading and writing information to and from memory cells Reading player input through switch blocks Mathematical operations, both unary and binary And much more! What do I need before I get into Mindustry Logic? A good thing to have beforehand is some programming experience, at least in regards to concepts and theory. This can help with understanding some of the techniques and concepts of this language. But most importantly, you need patience and an open mind , since a lot can change between updates and many things may seem daunting and complex until you try them out.

Data Types There are two main datatypes in Mindustry; numbers and Objects. number A decimal number. Can be negative or positive, and can represent true (anything not equal to 0) or false (0) values. Null is also represented as 0. Some instructions can only accept whole numbers, so it is indicated accordingly in this manual. Internally, numbers are stored as 64-bit floating point values ( double ), and operated upon as 64-bit signed integers ( long ) when bitshifting is involved. String An Object that represents text enclosed in quotes, e.g. \"hello mindustry\" Building An Object that represents a physical Building in a world. This is different from a Block ; a Block is simply a type of Building, but a Building is a tangible Block - as in, it has health, interacts with power and items, etc. Essentially, a Building is a Block that physically exists in a world. For example, the getlink instruction will return a Building Object, which you can get information about using sensor . Unit An Object that represents a Unit in a world, including the player. For example, the ubind instruction will set a processor variable @unit to a Unit Object representing a bound unit. Parameter Types These are like data types, but only work as parameters for instructions, and are not returned by any instruction. BuildingType content A type of Building. Starts with @ . Within the game's code, this is better referred to as \"Block\". However, for the sake of readability in this manual, we will call it BuildingType.

Each one has a name and value. Mindustry has variables which can be set by the user and their code, and constants which are set only by the processor and cannot be changed by the user. To find out the possible data or parameter types of a variable or constant, see the Glossary. Variables Creating and Changing Variables Variables are what their name suggests; a value that can be changed. For example, in this code: set myVariable 3 , the set instruction will create a variable named myVariable , and give it a value of 3 . Later on, this can change its value to 9 : set myVariable 9 . Notice how we used the same instruction for both creating and changing variables. This is because if a variable that it's changing does not already exist, an instruction will create it first. If you know Python, you'll probably have realized that it works in the same way. Another example is using sensor : sensor playerX playerUnit @x (or Sensor playerX = @x in playerUnit for the visual editor). Assuming that the player's position is 141, 20 , a variable named playerX will be created first, then assigned a value of 141 . However, we have another variable in the example called playerUnit . That variable is a parameter . A parameter is an input value to an instruction. In this case, we probably got playerUnit from the radar instruction. If a parameter is not provided or is invalid, the instruction will not execute. Data Types and Implicit Conversion The values in variables, of course, have different types that are specific to different sources and purposes, such as Unit for Units, number for any number, etc. You can find a list of all of them in the Glossary. Mindustry Logic also has this thing with variables called Implicit Conversion . That means that, if needed, it will convert a variable's value from one type to another. If an instruction is given a number , but it needs an Object , it will be converted to null . If an instruction needs a number , but is given an Object , it will be converted to 1 if the object isn't null , otherwise 0. Examples: 53 -> null null -> 0, Object which is a Silicon Crucible -> 1 The print instruction is the only instruction that requires a String as an input, so its rules are stated in its own part of the manual. Variable Naming Naming variables properly is an important skill to have when programming in general. It helps to make code easier to read and understand. Thus, that can make it easier for people to learn from or fix your code. Variable names can contain any typeable character. However, they cannot be purely numbers, since it will instead use the actual number. The usual naming convention among the majority of mlog code is camelCase, an example of which is itself. Examples of variables named using camelCase are: playerX , coreFound , vertexAngle . When naming variables, make sure they are descriptive yet short. They must describe the value they hold or their purpose. At the same time, they shouldn't be complete sentences or span the entire page, or be too short that they get confusing. You can use abbreviations, acronyms, or shorter terms to make them more concise. Everybody has their own specific styles and preferences, but try to learn from good examples of code in mlog and other languages, while at the same time staying close to the common style. Processor Variables and Constants Constants also hold values, but cannot be changed. Each processor has these constants and variables built-in: Processor @this constant Building A Building Object that represents the processor itself. You can use this with sensor to find various properties about the processor. @thisx constant number The x coordinate of the processor. @thisy constant number The y coordinate of the processor. @ipt constant number The number of instructions executed per tick (60 ticks/second). Micro Processor -> 2 Logic Processor -> 8 Hyper Processor -> 25 @counter variable number A variable that represents the next line the processor will read code from, equivalent to %IP in x86. It can be changed like any other variable as another way to perform jumps. An (advanced) example of setting @counter to jump to a function, then jump back to the caller: op add retAddr @counter 1 # Save where we will continue after the function returns by adding 1 to the counter set @counter myFunc # Jump to the line representing myFunc ... set @counter retAddr # Return to the line set earlier after the function is called Links @links constant number A constant that equals the number of buildings linked to the processor. It is changed by the processor when blocks are linked or unlinked. You can use this along with getlink to loop through all linked buildings, like so: set linkIter 0 # Create iterator variable getlink block linkIter # Get Building Object of the \"linkIter\"th linked building. # Do what you want with the building here jump 1 lessThan linkIter @links # Loop constant Building This is really multiple constants, one for each building linked to the processor. They are removed or added whenever a building is unlinked or linked to the processor. buildingName represents the building's internal name , which you can find in the rest of the Wiki. n starts at 1 and increases with each building of that type that are linked. It's sort of like the n th building of a type. This can be a little hard to understand, so here are some examples: The first Scatter linked to a processor: scatter1 The third Ripple linked: ripple3 The second Laser Drill linked: drill2 The eleventh Spore Press linked: press11 You can also view each linked building's \"constant name\" over them when the processor is selected. Misc @unit constant Unit A constant that represents the current bound unit. It only changes when the processor unbinds a unit, or binds another one. It can be accessed using Unit instructions such as ucontrol , ulocate , and uradar . Since it's a Unit Object, you can also use it with sensor . This presents a core part of unit control in mlog; only one unit can be bound at a time. However, you can reference this in a variable, like set unitReference @unit . That variable, though, can not be used to control the referenced unit. It can only be used to check against other units or to get information about it. Therefore, you can think of it as a \"unit identity\". @time constant number Represents the current UNIX timestamp in milliseconds . @tick constant float Represents the amount of ticks (60 ticks/second) since the map began. @mapw constant number Width of the map, in tiles. @maph constant number Height of the map, in tiles.","title":"Variables and Constants"},{"location":"logic/3-variables/#variables-and-constants","text":"Variables and constants are essentially \"containers\" of values.

Assuming that the player's position is 141, 20 , a variable named playerX will be created first, then assigned a value of 141 . However, we have another variable in the example called playerUnit . That variable is a parameter . A parameter is an input value to an instruction. In this case, we probably got playerUnit from the radar instruction. If a parameter is not provided or is invalid, the instruction will not execute.","title":"Creating and Changing Variables"},{"location":"logic/3-variables/#data-types-and-implicit-conversion","text":"The values in variables, of course, have different types that are specific to different sources and purposes, such as Unit for Units, number for any number, etc. You can find a list of all of them in the Glossary. Mindustry Logic also has this thing with variables called Implicit Conversion . That means that, if needed, it will convert a variable's value from one type to another. If an instruction is given a number , but it needs an Object , it will be converted to null . If an instruction needs a number , but is given an Object , it will be converted to 1 if the object isn't null , otherwise 0.

Examples of variables named using camelCase are: playerX , coreFound , vertexAngle . When naming variables, make sure they are descriptive yet short. They must describe the value they hold or their purpose. At the same time, they shouldn't be complete sentences or span the entire page, or be too short that they get confusing. You can use abbreviations, acronyms, or shorter terms to make them more concise.

There are many ways to use the modding API, depending on exactly what you want to do, and how far you're willing to go to do it. You could just resprite existing game content, you can create new game content with the simpler Json API (which is the main focus of this documentation), you can add custom sounds (or reuse existing ones). It's possible to add maps to campaign mode, and add scripts to program special behavior into your mod, like custom effects. Sharing your mod is as simple as giving someone your project directory; mods are also cross platfrom to any platform that supports them. You'll want to use GitHub ( or a similar service ) for hosting your source code. To make mods all you really need is any computer with a text editor. Directory Structure Your project directory should look something like this: project \u251c\u2500\u2500 mod.hjson \u251c\u2500\u2500 content \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 items \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 blocks \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 liquids \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 units \u251c\u2500\u2500 maps \u251c\u2500\u2500 bundles \u251c\u2500\u2500 sounds \u251c\u2500\u2500 schematics \u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts \u251c\u2500\u2500 sprites-override \u2514\u2500\u2500 sprites mod.hjson (required) metadata file for your mod, content/* directories for game Content , maps/ directory for in-game maps, bundles/ directory for Bundles , sounds/ directory for Sound files, schematics/ directory for Schematic files, scripts/ directory for Scripts , sprites-override/ Sprites directory for overriding ingame content, sprites/ Sprites directory for your content, Every platform has a different user application data directory, and this is where your mods should be placed: Linux: ~/.local/share/Mindustry/mods/ Steam: steam/steamapps/common/Mindustry/mods/ Windows: %appdata%/Mindustry/mods/ MacOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Mindustry/mods/ Note that your filenames should be lowercased and hyphen separated: correct: my-custom-block.json incorrect: My Custom Block.json Hjson Mindustry uses Hjson , which for anyone who knows Json, is simply a superset of the very popular serialization language known as Json . \u2013 This means that any valid Json will work, but you get extra useful stuff: # single line comment // single line comment /* multiline comment */ key1: single line string key2: ''' multiline string ''' key3: [ value 1 value 2 value 3 ] key4: { key1: string key2: 0 } If you don't know any of those words. \u2013 A serialization language, is simply a language which encodes information for a program, and encode means to translate informantion from one form to another, and in this case, to translate text into Java data structures. mod.hjson At the root of your project directory, you must have a mod.json which defines the basic metadata for your project. This file can also be (optionally) named mod.hjson to potentially help your text editor pick better syntax highlighting. name: \"mod-name\" displayName: \"This isn't a mod.\" author: Yourself description: \"Bbfashbjhcbabfhsbafbhajbf\" version: \"1.0\" minGameVersion: \"139\" dependencies: [ ] hidden: false name will be used to reference to your mod, so name it carefully; displayName this will be used as a display name for the UI, which you can use to add formatting to said name; description of the mod will be rendered in the ingame mod manager, so keep it short and to the point; dependencies is optional, if you want to know more about that, go to the dependencies section; minGameVersion is the minimum build version of the game. This is required to be a number greater than 105. hidden is whether or not this mod is essential for multiplayer, false by default. Texture packs, JS plugins, etc. should use this as to not cause conflicts with servers and clients respectively. As a rule of thumb, if your mod creates content it shouldn't be hidden. Content At the root of your project directory you can have a content/ directory, this is where all the Json/Hjson data goes. Inside of content/ you have subdirectories for the various kinds of content, these are the current common ones: content/items/ for items , like copper and surge-alloy ; content/blocks/ for blocks , like turrets and floors; content/liquids/ for liquids , like water and slag ; content/units/ for flying or ground units , like eclipse and dagger ; Note that each one of these subdirectories needs a specific content type. The filenames of these files is important, because the stem name of your path (filename without the extension) is used to reference it. Furthermore the files within these content/<content-type>/* directories may be arbitrarly nested into other sub-directories of any name, to help you organize them further, for example: content/items/metals/iron.hjson , which would respectively create an item named iron . The content of these files will tend to look something like this: type: TypeOfThing name: Name Of Thing description: Description of thing. # ... more fields here ... field type notes type String Content type of this object. name String Displayed name of content. description String Displayed description of content. Other fields included will be the fields of the type itself. A side note, name and description are not required to be in the json structure. You can define them for any language with (Bundles)[#bundles]. However, if they are not present in either then the name will be . - .name and an empty description respectively. Types Types have numerous fields, but the important one is type ; this is a special field used by the content parser, that changes which type your object is. A Router type can't be a Turret type , as they're just completely different. Types extend each other, so if MissileBulletType extends BasicBulletType , you'll have access to all the fields of BasicBulletType inside of MissileBulletType like damage , lifetime and speed . Fields are case sensitive: hitSize =/= hitsize . What you can expect a field to do is up to the specific type, some types do absolutely nothing with their fields, and work mostly as a base types will extend from. One such type is Block . In this unit example, the type of the unit is flying . The type of the bullet is BulletType , so you can use MissileBulletType , because MissileBulletType extends BulletType . One could also use mech , legs , naval or payload as the unit type here. type: flying weapons: [ { bullet: { type: MissileBulletType damage: 9000 } } ] As of build 125.1 , types can also be the fully-qualified class name of a Java class. For example, to specify a block as a MendProjector , you may write type: mindustry.world.blocks.defense.MendProjector instead of type: MendProjector . While not particularly useful for vanilla types, this can be used to load block types from other Java mods as dependencies. Tech Tree Much like type there exist another magical field known as research which can go at the root of any block object to put it in the techtree. research: duo This would put your block after duo in the techtree, and to put it after your own mods block you would write your <block-name> , a mod name prefix is only required if you're using the content from another mod. Research costs: type cost notes blocks requirements ^ 1.1 * 20 * researchCostMultiplier researchCostMultiplier is a stat that can be set on blocks units requirements ^ 1.1 * 50 --- The cost is then rounded down to the nearest 10, 100, 1k, 10k, or 100k depending on how expensive the cost is. requirements is the cost of the block or unit. Units use their build cost/upgrade cost for the calculations. If you want to set custom research requirements use this object in place of just a name: research: { parent: duo requirements: [ copper/100 ] } This can be used to override block or unit costs, or make resources need to be researched instead of just having to produce it. Sprites All you need to make sprites, is an image editor that supports transparency (aka: not paint). Block sprites should be 32 * size , so a 2x2 block would require a 64x64 image. Images must be PNG files with a 32-bit RGBA pixel format. Any other pixel format, such as 16-bit RGBA, may cause Mindustry to crash with a \"Pixmap decode error\". You can use the command-line tool file to print information about your sprites: file sprites/**.png If any of them are not 32-bit RGBA formatted, fix them. Sprites can simply be dropped in the sprites/ subdirectory. The content parser will look through it recursively. Images are packed into an \"atlas\" for efficient for rendering. The first directory in sprites/ , e.g. sprites/blocks , determines the page in this atlas that sprites are put in. Putting a block's sprite in the units page is likely to cause lots of lag; thus, you should try to organize things similarly to how the vanilla game does . Content is going to look for sprites relative to it's own name. content/blocks/my-hail.json has the name my-hail and similarly sprites/my-hail.png has the name my-hail , so it'll be used by this content. Content may look for multiple sprites. my-hail could be a turret, and it could look for the suffix <name>-heat and what this means is it'll look for my-hail-heat . You can find all the vanilla sprites here: https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/tree/master/core/assets-raw/sprites Another thing to know about sprites is that some of them are modified by the game. Turrets specifically have a black border added to them, so you must account for that while making your sprites, leaving transparent space around turrets for example: Ripple To override ingame content sprites, you can simply put them in sprites-override/ . This removes the <modname>- prefix to their id, which allows them to override sprites from vanilla and even other mods. You can also use this to create sprites with nice short names like cat for easy use with scripts, just beware of name collisions with other mods. Sound Custom sounds can be added through the modding system by dropping them in the sounds/ subdirectory. It doesn't matter where you put them after that. Two formats are supported: ogg and mp3 . Note that mp3 files cannot loop seamlessly, so try to use ogg whenever possible. Just like any other assets, you reference them by the stem of your filenames, so pewpew.ogg and pewpew.mp3 can be referenced with pewpew from a field of type Sound . Here's a list of built-in sounds: artillery back bang beam bigshot bioLoop blaster bolt boom breaks build buttonClick cannon chatMessage click combustion conveyor corexplode cutter door drill drillCharge drillImpact dullExplosion electricHum explosion explosionbig extractLoop fire flame flame2 flux glow grinding hum largeCannon largeExplosion laser laserbeam laserbig laserblast lasercharge lasercharge2 lasershoot machine malignShoot mediumCannon message mineDeploy minebeam missile missileLarge missileLaunch missileSmall missileTrail mud noammo pew place plantBreak plasmaboom plasmadrop press pulse pulseBlast railgun rain release respawn respawning rockBreak sap shield shockBlast shoot shootAlt shootAltLong shootBig shootSmite shootSnap shotgun smelter spark spellLoop splash spray steam swish techloop thruster titanExplosion torch tractorbeam unlock wave wind wind2 wind3 windhowl none Dependencies You can add dependencies to your mod by simple adding other mods name in your mod.json : dependencies: [ other-mod-name not-a-mod ] The name of dependencies are lower-cased and spaces are replaced with - hyphens, for example Other MOD NamE becomes other-mod-name . To reference the other mods assets, you must prefix the asset with the other mods name: other-mod-name-not-copper would reference not-copper in other-mod-name other-mod-name-angry-dagger would reference angry-dagger in other-mod-name not-a-mod-angry-dagger would reference angry-dagger in not-a-mod Bundles An optional addition to your mod is called bundles. The main use of bundles are give translations of your content, but there's no reason you couldn't use them in English. These are plaintext files which go in the bundles/ subdirectory, and they should be named something like bundle_ru.properties (for Russian). The contents of this file is very simple: block.example-mod-silver-wall.name = \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0440\u044f\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0430 block.example-mod-silver-wall.description = \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0440\u0430. If you've read the first few sections of this guide, you'll spot it right away: <content type>.<mod name>-<content name>.name <content type>.<mod name>-<content name>.description With your own custom bundle lines for use in scripts you can use whatever key you like: message.egg = Eat your eggs randomline = Random Line Notes: mod/content names are lowercased and hyphen separated.

If you don't know what Git (or GitHub) is at all, then you should look into GitHub Desktop , otherwise simply use your favorite command line tool or text editor plugin. All you need understand is how to open repositories on GitHub, stage and commit changes in your local repository, and push changes to the GitHub repository. Once your project is on GitHub, there are three ways to share it: with the endpoint, for example Anuken/MindustryJavaModTemplate , which could then be typed in the ingame GitHub interface, and that would download it; with the zip file, for example https://github.com/Anuken/MindustryJavaModTemplate/archive/master.zip , which would download the repository as a zip file, and put in mod directory (unzipping is not required); add the topic/tag mindustry-mod on your repository, which should add it to the topic search and the Mod scraper . FAQ time in game is calculated through ticks ; ticks sometimes called frames , are assumed to be 1/60th of a second; tilesize is 8 units internally; to calculate range out of lifetime and speed you can do lifetime * speed = range ; Abstract what is abstract ? All you need to know about abstract types is that they cannot be instantiated/initialized by themselves. If you do so, you'll get an \"initialization exception\" of some kind; what is a NullPointerException ? This is an error message that indicates a field is null and shouldn't be null, meaning one of the required fields may be missing; bleeding-edge what is bleeding-edge ? This is the developer version of Mindustry, specifically it's refering to the Github master branch. Changes on bleeding-edge usually make it into Mindustry in the next release.","title":"Modding Introduction"},{"location":"modding/1-modding/#modding-introduction","text":"Mindustry mods are simply directories of assets.

This removes the <modname>- prefix to their id, which allows them to override sprites from vanilla and even other mods.

The spriting style in Mindustry is simple yet very restrictive; what you can get away with in other games looks out of place in Mindustry. You can find all the vanilla sprites here . Please note that using other modders' sprites without their permission is not allowed, although you may use them for inspiration or reference. Reasoning such as \"The mod is open-source, I can do whatever I want with it,\" or something similar will not be acknowledged or tolerated and your mod will be blacklisted from the mod browser. Spriting Software It is highly recommended that you use spriting software that supports transparency and exporting images in .PNG format. Below is a list of recommended software. Desktop Aseprite The gold standard. Has a bit of a learning curve, but it is very simple once you get used to it. It is paid software, but you can compile the source code on your own . Please buy a license to support its developers. Has many features useful for Mindustry spriting such as: Mirroring Pallete Control Animation Layering (Can also export individual layers) LibreSprite A fork of the Aseprite repository, not as up-to-date or as powerful as Aseprite, but it should work for spriting in Mindustry style. Piskel A straightforward pixel art software that is not as powerful as Aseprite or LibreSprite, but it is sufficient. There is an online version & an offline downloadable version, both with the same features. Cannot export individual layers Pixilart An online spriting tool that has more features than Piskel though it lacks a mirror tool. If you're more familiar with pixilart, use this over piskel. Pretty bloated for spriting in Mindustry style. Paint.NET Very basic painting software, not to be confused with Paint 3D, Paint.NET is usable but not as convenient as the above mentioned. Paint.NET lacks basic features needed for spriting in mindustry style. You can get some of these missing features with plugins. That said, it is not recommended to use this for the sake of convenience. If you can download Paint.NET, you can probably download Piskel or LibreSprite instead, which are meant for pixel art. Mobile Novix Pixel Editor Old and reliable, made and abandoned by Anuke, it is simple, has no ads, though a bit old, it is still reliable as a spriting tool for mobile users, also supports the mirror tool. Occasionally breaks if spriting a larger sprite. Pixel Studio One of the most popular pixel art software. Has most of the features you need and it can also link with its PC version. Has ads Ibispaint X Not meant for spriting, and requires some setting changes before use. Supports various tools like octal mirrors, bloom, and gradients, as well as fundamental features like region select and layers. Can be used to sprite complex sprites with ease, but could be bloated for simple sprites. Also has ads Size Blocks The smallest block sprite you can make is 32px \u00d7 32px , which is a 1\u00d71 block. Making bigger blocks means increasing the sprite size by an additional 32px , so a 2\u00d72 block is 64 \u00d7 64 , and so on. This applies to both turrets and blocks. 1\u00d71 : 32px \u00d7 32px 2\u00d72 : 64px \u00d7 64px 3\u00d73 : 96px \u00d7 96px 4\u00d74 : 128px \u00d7 128px 5\u00d75 : 160px \u00d7 160px You are not limited to these sizes; the game will still load sprites bigger or smaller than the recommended sprite, which can result in a unique-looking sprite, or an atrocity. Items, Liquid, Statuses For these content types, the minimum sprite size is 32px ; you can use larger images, but the game will squish them down to 32px . The game will not enlarge smaller images, so 32px is the minimum. Units Unit sprite sizes are more lenient than others, though try not to go below 48px . The bigger your units are, the more you will have to adjust their hitSize (hitbox size). Storing Sprites Sprites can be dropped in the sprites/ subdirectory of your mod if it is hJSON, or src/assets/sprites/ if it is a Java mod. The content parser will look through it recursively. Images are packed into an \"atlas\" for efficient rendering. The first directory in sprites/, e.g., sprites/blocks , determines the page in this atlas that sprites are put in. Putting a block's sprite in the units folder is likely to cause lots of lag; thus, you should try to organize things similarly to how the vanilla game does. The game will look for sprites for content based on its name. content/blocks/test-turret.json has the name test-turret , and similarly, sprites/test-turret.png has the name test-turret , so it will be used by this content. - Blocks should be stored in sprites/blocks - Units should be stored in sprites/units - Items should be stored in sprites/items The game will modify some sprites. Turrets and units will have a 3-4px gray border added to them, so you must account for that while making your sprites, leaving space around turrets. Default outline radius and color can be customized by changing the outlineRadius / outlineColor fields in the Block and UnitType classes. Overriding Overriding existing sprites is possible; for this, sprites must be placed at sprites-override/ . Suffixes The game also can look for multiple sprites for a single block. For turrets, the game could look for the suffix <name>-heat ( test-turret-heat.png ). For blocks and crafters/smelters, the game may look for <name>-top , and <name>-liquid , which will be documented in their section. You can read the source code for each respective block class for what sprites they can load for more details. See the lines with @Load . For sprites in mods, check each load() method within the block class, if there is one. Color Pallete Just like every game out there, Mindustry has its color palette. For beginners, it is highly recommended to stick to these specific colors for your sprites, or it may look out of place at best and even become heretical at worst. It may inflict great disturbance upon the #spriting Discord channel. Block Color Pallete: Environment Color Pallete Assuming you have correctly acquired proper spriting software, you should be able to download these images and use them as a color palette. Styles and Shading Mindustry has a simple yet restrictive art style. What may work for other games will look out of place in Mindustry. Because of this, guidelines have been established to help modders to create sprites that will fit in the game. Mindustry is a 2D game, so to add depth such as elevation and depression, we need to do a trick called 'shading'. Despite the actual asset being a 2D image, this trick makes it look 3D in-game. Depending on where the light is shined, elevations are marked with lighter tone , flat areas with the midtone , and depressions with the darker tone . Picturing something in its 3D form and then drawing it in 2D is usually a good way to sprite something in Mindustry. This is only a guideline, however if you bend it without having made successful Mindustry sprites first, you will most likely create an abomination, and the #spriting channel will not be happy. Block Shading We will use the Surge Smelter as an example. With blocks, the light source is near the top right corner, and the shadows are in the bottom left . Pixels in the top right, which are close to the light source, should be light colored. Likewise, pixels in the bottom right should be dark. It works best to have a diagonal line through the middle separating them. Most blocks have 3 color types: Base color, which has 3 shades: B0BAC0 | Light Tone 989AA4 | Midtone 6E7080 | Dark Tone Decal color, which also has 3 shades: FEB380 | Lght Tone EA8878 | Midtone BC5452 | Dark Tone Bottom color 4a4b53 Base Color represents the primary color of the block. It is recommmended to only use shades of gray for crafters, as all vanilla crafters do. Decal Color is the accent color on your block. It represents the block's role or purpose and a way to differentiate them from each other. To pick what decal color to use for your blocks, you should think about your block's purpose. For example: Plastanium Compressor Plastanium Compressor has a green decal. This green decal is the same color as plastanium. Therefore, just by looking at it you can tell this block has a connection with plastanium. Bottom Color represents the insides of the block, where no light reaches, so it should be very dark. This could represent the bottom of a block with a chimney, like the Surge Smelter, for example. Please note that different blocks require different amounts of layers depending on their type; for example, a wall would need only 1 layer, which is the sprite itself, while blocks like a reconstructor would need up to 4. See #suffixes . Modded Examples: Unit Bunker by Flin#8261 from DiverseTech Steam Press by Geschiedenis #4783 from Unlimited Armament Works Turret Shading With Turret shading, the light source is on the right side , and the shadows are on the left . We will use the ' Ripple ' as an example for this part. Turrets in general has 2 to 3 color type with 2 tone for each: Base color 7B7B7B | Light Tone 4D4E58 | Dark Tone Decal color FEB380 | Light Tone EA8878 | Dark Tone [Optional] Barrel Hole Color 2C2D38 Base Color or Body-Color, is the primary color of the turret. This can be classic copper brown, white, dark grey, or a custom color(from the palette!). Copper Brown Usually represents a low tier turret, such as Duo , Scorch , Hail , etc. C9A58F 8F665B White Usually represents turret that uses power instead of items to shoot, such as Arc , Lancer , Paralax , Segment . F4F4F4 C1C3D4 Dark Gray In most cases, dark grey represents mid to high tier turret. 7B7B7B 4D4E58 Decal color in the turret is the same as regular block; it is an accent color and can represent the turret's role, purpose, or archetype. For example, if you are trying to group your turrets into different classes, you can differentiate them by decal color. Barrel Hole is an optional color for turrets that represents the barrel hole of your turret; this is usually used for artillery turrets or missile launchers. 2C2D38 Unconventional Methods Turret Midtone Still a relatively new unconventional method is adding midtones into turret sprites to make it seem to have a flat surface, instead of only light and dark tones. One example of this is the \"Skyhammer\" from Unlimited Armament Works Resources Shading Resource shading is quite simple and can have its light coming from top corners , top to down , or right to left . Resource sprites should only use 2 or 3 shades of one color. Make sure the sprite looks 3d and not flat, as then it will stick out like a paper thumb. Examples: Unit Shading Units are generally the hardest to shade. Unit shading can get pretty complex for bigger units. In unit shading, light comes from the top to bottom or front to back . The intensity of lighter tone and darker tone changes depending on what part you are working with on the unit. For units, light tone represents elevation , midtone represents flat area , and dark tone represents depression . Unit Base Color The Eclipse is used for this example as it is the most complicated vanilla unit. As you continuously work towards the backside, there will be less light tone and more midtone and dark tone. Parts that get lit by the light will have a lighter tone, while the ones that are not get a darker tone; flat areas are midtone. Above are the rough illustration of units if imagined in 3D. Base color, has 3 tones as usual: B0BAC0 | Light Tone 989AA4 | Midtone 6E7080 | Dark Tone Unit Decal Color Unit decal color only has 2 tones: light and dark. The color represents the unit's role in-game. Yellow Color represents Core units, which the Core produces. FFD37F | Light Tone D4816B | Dark Tone Orange Color represents Assault units, which have the role of attacking your opponents. FFA665 | Light Tone D06B53 | Dark Tone Green Color represents Support units that can build, heal, and shield your units. 84F491 | Light Tone 62AE7F | Dark Tone Purple Color represents ~~spooder~~ Specialist units, which do other things. BF92F9 | Light Tone 665C9F | Dark Tone You are free to pick whatever color you would like, as long as it's present on multiple units and fits with the other colors in the palette. Unit Cell/Team Color Unit Cells are sprites used to differentiate units between teams; they are separate sprites that will be loaded on top of the unit. Above is a fortress with its cell. The game will automatically replace the white (#FFFFF) and tan (#DCC6C6) colors with shades of team color. Your cell sprites should only have the two shades below: FFFFFF | Light Tone DCC6C6 | Dark Tone Spriting software capable of using layers and exporting them separately is highly recommended because you can sprite the unit itself and the cell on a separate layer within one file. Unit Weapons Unit Weapons follow the same rules as turrets and unit shading; they can be shaded from top to bottom or right to left . Weapons' rotation is based on the centre of the sprite; if you want to shift the weapon rotation point, you must shift the sprite. Unit Spriting Stages The process of drawing units can be roughly divided into 5 stages: Scribble down the general shape. Pick a thick brush with a dark tone and paint it, slowly adding lines over each other and forming basic shapes without much precision. Try to make them slightly deformed or curved, and make sure the shape looks nice - you cannot make a good sprite out of a bad shape in most cases, so make sure you are satisfied before you move on. Refine the shape and make it out of lines angled at 45 degrees. You may want to tweak edges, and don't try to follow the doodle you already made too closely. Add decals. This is tricky because decals are hard to get right. I showed 3 examples that work - you should experiment for yourself, however, and see what works best for you. The reason why it's better to add them now is that later you will be able to \"build shades\" around decals, making it easier to proceed at stage 5. Roughly mark the lighter and darker parts. Since the light comes from the top, you can and should help yourself and mark what shapes you want to be illuminated the least or the most right away to spare yourself from overthinking about it. Refrain from covering too much space because around 30-40% of the sprite should be the dark shade. Also, note that you should leave the area around decals dark to increase the contrast and make it more appealing to look at. By far the most complex part - \"add details\". There are not many tricks you can use; you have to get good at this. However, there is one I use: when uncertain about what should you add, add cells there. They can work like extra decals, and you may want to build your shapes around them.

Outlines Leave 4 pixels of space around the edges of turret sprites and unit sprites, as the game will use that space to automatically add outlines. Evironmental Sprites Environmental sprites are a bit different from the rest of the Mindustry spriting style, which is that the 45\u00b0 increment rule doesn't apply . Environmental sprites will make up most, if not the majority, of a Mindustry game, so it should be in your best interest that the sprite you've made is subtle enough and looks great despite being tiled over and over again. Floors Floors only have 2 color tones, and the number of variations is up to you. Vanilla Examples : Modded Examples : Sprites by Sh1penfire#0868 from Endless-Rusting Static Walls Not to be confused with buildable defenses, environmental walls have 3 color tones , and just like floors, the number of variations is up to you. Walls also have an optional 2x2 version, which is randomly mixed in with the 1x1 walls. Vanilla Example : Modded Example : Sprites by Sh1penfire#0868 from Endless-Rusting Ores Ores are overlaid on top of floors, so they should look decent across all floor textures they will likely be placed on.

What may work for other games will look out of place in Mindustry. Because of this, guidelines have been established to help modders to create sprites that will fit in the game. Mindustry is a 2D game, so to add depth such as elevation and depression, we need to do a trick called 'shading'. Despite the actual asset being a 2D image, this trick makes it look 3D in-game. Depending on where the light is shined, elevations are marked with lighter tone , flat areas with the midtone , and depressions with the darker tone . Picturing something in its 3D form and then drawing it in 2D is usually a good way to sprite something in Mindustry. This is only a guideline, however if you bend it without having made successful Mindustry sprites first, you will most likely create an abomination, and the #spriting channel will not be happy.","title":"Styles and Shading"},{"location":"modding/4-spriting/#block-shading","text":"We will use the Surge Smelter as an example. With blocks, the light source is near the top right corner, and the shadows are in the bottom left . Pixels in the top right, which are close to the light source, should be light colored. Likewise, pixels in the bottom right should be dark. It works best to have a diagonal line through the middle separating them. Most blocks have 3 color types: Base color, which has 3 shades: B0BAC0 | Light Tone 989AA4 | Midtone 6E7080 | Dark Tone Decal color, which also has 3 shades: FEB380 | Lght Tone EA8878 | Midtone BC5452 | Dark Tone Bottom color 4a4b53 Base Color represents the primary color of the block. It is recommmended to only use shades of gray for crafters, as all vanilla crafters do. Decal Color is the accent color on your block. It represents the block's role or purpose and a way to differentiate them from each other. To pick what decal color to use for your blocks, you should think about your block's purpose. For example: Plastanium Compressor Plastanium Compressor has a green decal. This green decal is the same color as plastanium. Therefore, just by looking at it you can tell this block has a connection with plastanium. Bottom Color represents the insides of the block, where no light reaches, so it should be very dark. This could represent the bottom of a block with a chimney, like the Surge Smelter, for example. Please note that different blocks require different amounts of layers depending on their type; for example, a wall would need only 1 layer, which is the sprite itself, while blocks like a reconstructor would need up to 4.

Pick a thick brush with a dark tone and paint it, slowly adding lines over each other and forming basic shapes without much precision. Try to make them slightly deformed or curved, and make sure the shape looks nice - you cannot make a good sprite out of a bad shape in most cases, so make sure you are satisfied before you move on. Refine the shape and make it out of lines angled at 45 degrees. You may want to tweak edges, and don't try to follow the doodle you already made too closely. Add decals. This is tricky because decals are hard to get right. I showed 3 examples that work - you should experiment for yourself, however, and see what works best for you. The reason why it's better to add them now is that later you will be able to \"build shades\" around decals, making it easier to proceed at stage 5. Roughly mark the lighter and darker parts. Since the light comes from the top, you can and should help yourself and mark what shapes you want to be illuminated the least or the most right away to spare yourself from overthinking about it. Refrain from covering too much space because around 30-40% of the sprite should be the dark shade. Also, note that you should leave the area around decals dark to increase the contrast and make it more appealing to look at. By far the most complex part - \"add details\". There are not many tricks you can use; you have to get good at this. However, there is one I use: when uncertain about what should you add, add cells there. They can work like extra decals, and you may want to build your shapes around them.

General Changes Minimum Game Version All mods must now specify minGameVersion with a value of \"105\" or above to be loaded. This is to ensure that outdated mods do not get loaded. Simply add minGameVersion: \"139\" to your mod.hjson file. Name Changes Variable & Class name changes ItemTurret : ammo -> ammoTypes reload -> reloadTime ArtilleryTurret , BurstTurret , ChargeTurret : Removed. Use ItemTurret or PowerTurret instead; all the functionality has been merged into the base classes. BasicBulletType : bulletWidth -> width bulletHeight -> height bulletSprite -> sprite TileEntity -> Building TileEntity is now Building . Thus, the former TileEntity 's functions, as well as any function associated with it(containing or mentioning \"entity\") have been renamed, now they will refer to the TileEntity to \"building\", or \"build\". Tile.entity has been renamed to Tile.build , and all TileEntity instances (ex. RouterEntity , ConveyorEntity ) were renamed to end with a \"Build\" suffix (ex. RouterBuild , ConveyorBuild ), to name a few. Many functions like draw() or placed() have moved from being declared in the Block to being so in Building . This means that these functions do not pass the Tile , as well as making block-specific behavior less complicated. Notably, update(Tile tile) has been moved to the Building and renamed (technically not true, but this detail can be ignored for porting) to updateTile() . Array -> Seq The arc.struct.Array has been renamed to arc.struct.Seq , which is a short form of Sequence . Why? It's more accurate. The data structure is not an array, it's a list like ArrayList . It doesn't conflict with other classes named Array , such as those in Java's reflection API or Javascript's array. It's shorter, which is nice. mindustry.plugin.Plugin -> mindustry.mod.Plugin The Plugin class has been moved into the mod package, as the old package only contained a single class anyway. Removal of \"on\" prefix for Call methods All remote invocation methods in Call have had their \"on\" prefix removed. For example: onSnapshot -> snapshot onSetRules -> setRules onLabel -> label New Player System Now that players control units, they no longer exist as corporeal beings in the game - that is to say, they do not have health or weapons. Every action is performed by Unit s. There is no Mech class anymore, only UnitType . Every unit has a UnitController , which can be AI, logic, or a player. To check if a unit is being controlled by a player, use unit.isPlayer() To get the player of a unit (if it has one), use unit.getPlayer() Setting a player's position will not do anything.

Tile.entity has been renamed to Tile.build , and all TileEntity instances (ex. RouterEntity , ConveyorEntity ) were renamed to end with a \"Build\" suffix (ex. RouterBuild , ConveyorBuild ), to name a few. Many functions like draw() or placed() have moved from being declared in the Block to being so in Building . This means that these functions do not pass the Tile , as well as making block-specific behavior less complicated.

The field is kept to ensure compatibility, but will be removed eventually. All mindustry.world.meta.values.* classes have been replaced with lambdas. See the StatValues class. BlockForge has been moved out of the experimental package, and will likely undergo significant changes. If you were using this class in a Java mod, I recommend copy-pasting it in so you can keep using the old version. Other experimental blocks may be moved as well. CacheLayer is now a class with methods that can be overridden - not an enum. CacheLayer#add can be used to register new layers. Various fields, like variants and attributes have been moved from Floor to Block . Iconc and related methods have been removed; use UnlockableContent.uiIcon/fullIcon . Smelter and AttributeSmelter have been deprecated. These classes had hard-coded drawing functionality. Transition to GenericCrafter with a DrawSmelter as quickly as possible. For attribute support, use AttributeCrafter . Cultivator is deprecated for the same reasons as Smelter , use AttributeCrafter instead. ExtendingItemBridge and LiquidExtendingBridge have been merged with ItemBridge / LiquidBridge , use those instead. PayloadAcceptor was a misleading name in the wrong package, use PayloadBlock instead. Generated icons must be created in createIcons now; attempting to use Core.atlas.addRegion simply will not work. LiquidModule#total() has been deprecated; use currentAmount() instead. Ammo Any mod code that worked with unit ammo is now broken. The ResupplyPoint class has been removed. AmmoType is now an interface, not a class. AmmoTypes has been removed, make new instances instead. Ammo type classes have been moved into the mindustry.type.ammo package.

SettingsDialog ( Vars.ui.settings ) has been moved into Mindustry's codebase. This technically doesn't change the API; however, Java mods compiled with 6.0 source will try to access non-existent fields of a non-existent class, leading to crashes.

Core.net has been removed, use the static methods in arc.util.Http instead. RidgedPerlin has been renamed to Ridged . Simplex and Ridged are now stateless; use static methods to generate noise now.
